We partnered with a local utility company to develop a behavioral segmentation and forecasting model based on natural gas consumption in order to validate their current segmentation and also to provide support their efforts to develop a short-term weather-based demand forecast.
* [**D-Optimality with Level Balance Constraints**](/Fedorov):
Optimizing design efficiency for fractional-factorial choice research that incorporates interaction and distribution constraints.  Write-up includes business application, d-efficiency theory, and R implementations for a modified Fedorov Algorithm and an alternative genetic algorithm alternative.
